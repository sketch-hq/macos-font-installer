# MacOS font installer

This is a small script to install all freely downloadable fonts into a Mac OS computer. It's equivalent to opening the Font app and installing all fonts that are available there.

It's useful to run on systems where you may open documents created by a large variety of users and prefer to spend the time downloading the fonts upfront.

## Deployment

Any commit to a branch builds a version, you can access it from CircleCI artifacts.
Any version tag (vX.Y.Z) will triger a release and will upload the binaries to a github release.
